# Places

Places can be of 4 different types:

1. Country
2. City
3. Airport
4. Anywhere (flights browse API)

You can use any of the following endpoints to get information about places:

* our [Autosuggest](#list-of-places) endpoint to obtain a list of places and corresponding IDs that match a query string

* our [Autosuggest](#place-information) endpoint to get information about a specific place given its ID (for example, city name and country name for an airport)

* our [Geo catalog](#geo-catalog) to get the full list of places that we support (please [contact us](https://partners.skyscanner.net/contact/) to request access)

<aside class="warning">
The country and language must be included in the Autosuggest query so that the most relevant results can be returned in the correct language.

Each place can be referred to via different schemas, described below.

*SCHEMAS*

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| sky | Skyscanner code. The response from [Autosuggest](#place-information) provides these ids. |
| iata / iso | Airports and cities often use the internationally recognized IATA and ISO schemas.<br>For <b>Flights</b> we recommend that you use the Skyscanner code which is very similar but solves ambiguous cases where a city and one of its airports share the same code. For <b>Car Hire</b> please use the IATA code.|
| GeoNameCodes | GeoNameCodes from the GeoNames schema (see [geonames.org](www.geonames.org))|
| GeoNameIDs | GeoNameIDs from the GeoNames schema (see [geonames.org](www.geonames.org))|


If the default Skyscanner schema is not used, the schema name must be appended to the place id as follows:
`placeCode-locationSchema`
